      I'm a junior frontend developer passionate about creating clean,
      accessible, and responsive user interfaces. I focus on turning designs
      into functional experiences while continually improving my skills in
      performance, usability, and modern web technologies.

    <p class="text-2xl opacity-">
      As a Front-End Developer Intern at DepEd CALABARZON Region IV-A, I build
      and improve internal web apps, focusing on responsive and user-friendly
      interfaces. This role has enhanced my frontend skills and deepened my
      understanding of usability, accessibility, and performance.
    </p>
    <p class="text-2xl opacity-60">
      My capstone project, ranked among the top 10 in my IT department, allowed
      me to explore both frontend and backend development. While I mainly
      focused on the frontend, this experience helped me build a solid
      foundation in backend technologies and fueled my passion for creating
      meaningful, user-centered solutions.
